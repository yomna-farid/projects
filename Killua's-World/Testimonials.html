        <p>"We thought we were getting a Blue Russian
          cat, but it turns out we lucked out with a Korat cat that thinks he's a
            dog. Killua loves to play fetch, can do 1 trick and that's giving his paw when he wants a treat.
            But he also loves belly rubs and will even come running when we call his name!" <br><br> - Yomna <br><br></p>

        <p>"I never knew I needed a Neighborhood Security Officer until Killua 
          moved in. He takes his job very seriously, and he's not afraid to let 
          us know when there's a suspicious noise outside. Thanks to him, we've 
          never had a package stolen from our porch!"<br><br> - Aosan <br><br></p>

          <p>"Killua is the ultimate box inspector. 
          We used to just toss our Amazon boxes in the corner, but now we know better. He 
          inspects every single one of them, and he won't rest until he's satisfied that they 
          meet his high standards. We're thinking of nominating him for an award at the next Box 
          Inspector Conference." <br><br> - Issar <br><br> </p>
