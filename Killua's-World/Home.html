      <h2>Hi I'm Killua :)</h2>
      <p>I'm a 1 and a half-year-old Korat Cat. I'm named after the
      character from the anime show called Hunter
      x Hunter, which is fitting because I love to hunt and play. I 
      have short, soft grey hair that compliments my piercing green eyes,
      which always seem to capture attention. I'm known as the wet food connoisseur, 
      I take my meals very seriously and have a discerning palate when 
      it comes to choosing my favorite flavors. I take my meals very
      seriously, and I expect nothing but the best. Overall, I am a curious 
      and adventurous feline who enjoys exploring new places and meeting
      new people.

      <h2>What I like to Do</h2>
        <p>Speaking of play, I love to play fetch - yes, you heard that right,
          cats can fetch toys too! When I'm not busy hunting or playing, I go around 
          the house and meowing as loudly at any closed doors until they're open for me.
          Being the boss of the house takes up a lot of time and effort, but 
          when I have free time I like to spend it hanging out with my tenants
          (aka my owners).</p>
