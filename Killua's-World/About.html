        <h2>Breed</h2>
        <p>
          The Korat is a small to medium-sized cat breed that originated in
          Thailand. They are known for their striking blue-grey coat, which is
          short, glossy, and often described as "metallic". They have large,
          round, green eyes, and their body is muscular and lean. Korats have a
          distinctive heart-shaped face and a friendly, affectionate
          personality. They are intelligent and curious cats that thrive on
          human interaction and attention, and they make great pets for families
          and individuals alike.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          The history of Korat cats can be traced back to ancient Thailand,
          where they were revered as symbols of good luck and prosperity. They
          were known as "Si-Sawat" in Thai, which means "color of the sawat
          seed", a reference to their blue-grey coat. Korats were highly valued
          and often given as gifts to important people, such as royalty and
          Buddhist monks. It wasn't until the mid-20th century that Korats were
          introduced to the Western world, and they quickly gained popularity as
          pets due to their unique appearance and friendly personality.

        <h2>Cool Facts</h2>
        <p>
          One cool fact about Korat cats is that they are believed to bring good
          luck to their owners. In Thailand, they are often given as gifts to
          newlyweds or people starting a new business. Another interesting fact
          is that Korats are sometimes referred to as "good luck cats" or
          "smiling cats" because of their unique facial expression. When a Korat
          is happy or content, their mouth forms a slight smile that is said to
          bring joy to those around them. Finally, Korats are known for their
          high intelligence and have been trained to perform tricks such as
          playing fetch and walking on a leash.
